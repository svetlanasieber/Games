# Snake Game 

## Overview
In this workshop, you will build a snake game from scratch, following the basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## Setup
You are provided with a skeleton, which contains the following items:

- **StartUp class** â€“ the entry point of your program.
- **Core folder** â€“ contains the main functionality of the program.
- **Enums folder** â€“ holds data about the snake's directions.
- **GameObjects folder** â€“ contains the main objects of the game.
- **Utilities folder** â€“ already written; includes information about your ConsoleWindow.

## Task 1: Structure

### Game Objects
In the `GameObjects` folder, create the following classes:

#### Point Class
- Represents the 2D space where all objects exist.
- **Properties**: 
  - `LeftX` and `TopY` - integers representing the horizontal and vertical positions of the object.
- **Methods**:
  - `Draw(symbol)` - uses `Console.SetCursorPosition` with the current point coordinates and writes the symbol on the console.
  - `Draw(leftX, topY, symbol)` - overloads the previous method.

**Constructor**: 
- Initializes `LeftX` and `TopY` with the provided values.

#### Wall Class
- Inherits from `Point` and extends its functionality.
- **Methods**:
  - `SetHorizontalLine(topY)` - iterates from zero to the current `LeftX` and draws the horizontal line with a square symbol (`\u25A0`).
  - `SetVerticalLine(leftX)` - similar to `SetHorizontalLine`, but for vertical lines.
  - `InitializeWallBorders()` - sets the horizontal and vertical lines for the four sides of the wall.

**Constructor**:
- Calls `InitializeWallBorders` to set up the wall.

#### Food Class (Abstract)
- Inherits from `Point` and implements the logic for different types of food in the game.
- **Property**:
  - `Points` - indicates the score given by each type of food.
- **Methods**:
  - `SetRandomPosition(Queue<Point> snakeParts)` - sets the position of the current food at a random place inside the wall, avoiding the snake's current position.
  - `IsFoodPoint(Point snakePosition)` - checks if the food is at the snakeâ€™s head position.
  - `Draw()` - draws the food on the console, potentially with a colorful background.

**Constructor**:
- Implements the basic setup for food items.

#### Child Classes of Food
- **FoodAsterisk**: 
  - **Symbol**: `*`
  - **Points**: 1
- **FoodDollar**:
  - **Symbol**: `$`
  - **Points**: 2
- **FoodHash**:
  - **Symbol**: `#`
  - **Points**: 3

#### Snake Class
- Manages the snake's behavior, movement, and interaction with food.
- **Fields**:
  - A queue holding all points representing the snake's body.
- **Methods**:
  - `CreateSnake()` - initializes the snake with a length of 6.
  - `GetFoods()` - initializes the food types.
  - `IsMoving(Point direction)` - controls snake movement and checks if it hits the wall or itself.
  - `GetNextPoint(Point direction)` - calculates the next position of the snakeâ€™s head based on the direction.
  - `Eat(Point direction, Point snakeHead)` - increases the snake's length after eating food and generates new food.

**Constructor**:
- Sets up the initial snake configuration.

#### Engine Class
- Manages the user interface and interactions.
- **Method**:
  - `Run()` - handles the main logic of the game, including direction input and snake movement.
  - `GetNextDirection()` - maps keyboard input to snake movement.
  - `AskUserForRestart()` - prompts the user to restart the game or exit.
  - `StopGame()` - displays "GameOver" and exits the game.

**Constructor**:
- Initializes the wall, snake, and sets up the default settings.

#### StartUp Class
- Initializes the wall, snake, and starts the game by calling the `Engine.Run()` method.

### Game Statistics
The game displays statistics on the right side of the screen. You can implement additional methods to show these statistics on the console.

Start the game and enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
